## Project Overview:

In response to tackling the Coronavirus pandemic, countries across the world have implemented a number of different policies to slow the spread oc COVID-19, including "stay-at-home orders," work place closures, school closures, as well as restrictions on social gatherings, public transportation, and cancellations of large events. Such measures were taken in order to slow the spread of the virus through limiting public movement and interactions.

What impact have these restrictions had on US citizens' movements around the country?

Google presented its COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports  (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) which measures visitor numbers to specfic category locations:

##### Retail & Recreation: Mobility trends for places like restaurants, cafes, shopping centers, theme parks, museums, libraries, and movie theaters. 
##### Grocery & Pharmacy: Mobility trends for places like grocery markets, food warehouses, farmers markets, specialty food shops, drug stores, and pharmacies. 
##### Parks: Mobility trends for places like national parks, public beaches, marinas, dog parks, plazas, and public gardens. 
##### Transit Stations: Mobility trends for places like public transport hubs such as subway, bus, and train stations. 
##### Workplaces:  Mobility trends for places of work. 
##### Residential: Mobility trends for places of residence. 


#### COVID Cases & Deaths
The New York Times released a series of data files with cumulative counts of coronavirus cases in the United States, at the state and county level, over time. Users can view the data to compare US states cases and deaths over time.

#### Pet Adoption & Intake During COVID
As Covid-19 changes our world and our daily habits, pets in the United States continue to be born, surrendered to shelters, and adopted into loving homes.  The charts represent data from 1200 animal welfare organizations around the country and compare weekly data from 2019 and 2020
